# Maximum-Entropy-Model-on-Vicsek-Dynamics
This repository holds code used for my undergraduate senior thesis, along with a pdf of the thesis itself. The project was to build a maximum entropy model (MEM) over a simulated flock obeying Vicsek dynamics. The MEM itself is borrowed from work done by Bialek et al used on actual flocks of starlings, testing ideas like what kind of interaction rules the birds follow. Please refer to the thesis pdf for more motivation and context, as well as an explanation of these concepts in more detail.
